# MARINE-Token

Welcome to the first custom token sale on the Fantom Network. This is for the Fantom Marines with strong hands through the ups and downs we have experienced hodling this coin. This token is for fun and testing out the transaction speed/cost of the network. There is no real utility other than testing and having some of these in your wallet to commemorate the early days of Fantom Finance. You can use the contract below to test how easy token swaps are on Fantom and once we sell through the presale, we will list this token on https://funi.exchange/ so that we can create a liquidity pool and get another asset on the exchange.
